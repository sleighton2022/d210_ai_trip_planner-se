Okay, I can generate an itinerary based on the preferences you provided for a trip to San Francisco, CA from April 17th, 2025 to April 19th, 2025 (meaning activities on the 17th and 18th).

Important Considerations:

Weather: As the dates are beyond the typical forecast range, specific weather predictions are unavailable. San Francisco weather in April can be variable (often cool, potentially foggy, especially near the coast, but sometimes sunny). Recommendations are based on typical conditions, but you must check the actual forecast closer to your travel date. Pack layers!
Traffic: Driving times are estimates and highly dependent on real-time traffic, which can be heavy in San Francisco. Consider using public transport, ride-sharing, or walking where feasible, especially around Fisherman's Wharf.
Bookings: Activities like Alcatraz Island must be booked well in advance, often months ahead. I will include it, but assume you can secure tickets.
Optimization: The plan aims to group activities geographically, considers family-friendliness, safety, and your interests (historical landmarks, parks, views), with a minimum rating of 0.0. No cost optimization is applied.
